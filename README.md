## Getting Started
### Install
If you just want to use Nextcloud Bookmarks, you can (soon) download it from the relases page.

### Build
You can build the app from scratch. Aside from Xcode 9 it has no further dependencies, so with Xcode installed you can build it from the commandline with `xcodebuild` or by running it from inside Xcode.

## Contributing
PRs are welcome! Please file your PR against the develop branch.
